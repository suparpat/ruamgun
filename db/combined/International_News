Why? Because nobody wanted to lose their primary puppet which is ISIS. All those superpowers preferred to play a dirty game. They wasted valuable time to bring a real long-lasting peace to Syria and also to Middle East. Syria has become a safe heaven and a playground for various terrrorist groups. Consequently Syrian refugees and Turkish citizens paid the highest price due to the instability, destabilization and chaos in Syria. \n\nBoth ISIS and its accomplice PKK/YPG have been terrorizing Turkey relentlessly. We lost too many lives whether it be soldiers, police officers, civilians or foreigners. Those terrorist groups have become a big threat to the unity of Turkey and stability of the whole region. Enough is enough. Turkey could not allow fait accompli or a defacto  situation accross her borders. There was no option for Turkey other than to take a decisive action against both ISIS and YPG in Syria. \n\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon and their methods are same. Suicide bombings, IEDs, complex attacks and assassinations, and this is what both ISIS and YPG have been doing in Turkey. Now time has come to get rid of terror threat directed both by ISIS and PKK/YPG against Turkey from Syria. \n\nTurkey is using her legitimate self-defense right. No more game, the marriage between ISIS and YPG is over. YPG has been intentionally polished and advertised by its sponsors for another dirty agenda. Nobody really cared about destroying ISIS or bringing peace to war-torn Syria. Those YPG sponsors never cared really about the humanitarian tragedy in Syria and never wanted to bring Syrian civil war to a peaceful solution. YPG is dissmissed from now on and their fooling of whole world until now is finished by Turkish intervention. Even US Senate Investigation Committe uncovered that YPG is organically connected with PKK which is officially accepted as a terrorist organization by US. ISIS and YPG coexistence, and symbiotic closeness between both these two terrorist groups are terminated forever. \n\nTurkey is in charge now against both ISIS and YPG terrorist groups not only for her own citizens but also for all those refugees and Syrian people. Multinational coalition forces are providing air support to Turkey's anti-ISIS operation named Euphrates Shield. Turkish Joint Special Task Force is providing support to Free Syrian Army to fight against ISIS. Turkey has always defended the unity of Syria, but it was a very complex political game what took place in Syria. \n\nTurkey was always a scapegoat and target of internationally organized anti-Turkey hate rhetorics and dirty propaganda. Those who had hidden or conflicting agenda in Syria never wanted to destroy ISIS, otherwise ISIS could not even stand a week against any multi-national coalition ground forces. Nobody wanted to lose their main puppet ISIS in Syria. Until now Turkey welcomed 3 million refugees in a short notice and never been frankly supported by UN, EU and USA. Nobody really cared about Syrians but Turkey. Would Europe allow so many refugees to EU countries like Turkey?  Would they be able to control their borders against flood of 3 million refugees?\n\nSo stop lying and fabricating fish-tales about Turkey and try to show sincere solidarity in her struggle and fight against international terrorist groups. Turkey will not step aside and watch ISIS and YPG terrorists harm Turkey and the unity of her citizens. Those who perpetrated and are still perpetrating terror attacks against Turkey shall now face the consequences.\n\nLast but not last, terror whether it is conducted by ISIS, PKK ot YPG will never be able to subjugate Turkish people.","id":"1277803818906638_1277975128889507"},{"like_count":2,"message":"lol, stick with the machine guns, because songs aren't going to do anything.

Never before have millions of vulnerable children been left alone to face all sorts of dangers. \n\nToday, 230 million children live in conflict zones and most of them get no help - and in most cases, not even a sideways glance - from that part of the world that is capable of helping. The world seems to be concerned with ‘supposedly more important issues’ like highly anticipated music albums, the latest fashion trends or sporting competitions. \n\nOddly, a big part of these children live in places where you wouldn't expect them to be in danger. Nonetheless, they are in danger and they are in the heart of Europe.\n\nThe Syrian War has destroyed a country and tore a whole nation apart, leaving millions without their families, homes, incomes or safety, as millions of Syrians had to look for a safe future elsewhere. As a result, 4.7 million Syrians are now refugees in other countries and there is simply nowhere left they can call home.\n\nHowever, before the war, Syrians led decent lives just like us. They were regular people with normal lives. They were doctors, teachers, engineers; mothers, fathers, grandparents, and schoolchildren. They probably never imagined that someday their ‘normal’ lives would be shattered into pieces and that they would find themselves in positions no one would want to be in. Yet that is exactly what happened, and millions of Syrians have had to turn to others for help, even if those others are usually unsympathetic or even downright hostile towards them.\n\nYou have certainly heard how droves of refugees constantly seek ways to reach Europe and embark on perilous ‘death voyages’. Many perish on the way but most of those who manage to set foot in Europe face shocking hostility, humiliation and rejection. An inexcusable ‘we don't want you here, go back to where you came from’ attitude is all too prevalent across Europe. Many of these downtrodden people are held in inhumane detention centers, including babies who sometimes have to sleep on the ground, and having to survive on a little amount of milk. Maybe worse, among these scores of people there are thousands of unaccompanied minors. You read that right; thousands of children without any adult supervision, completely exposed to all sorts of dangers. Their ages vary from 1 to 17.\n\nUnpredictably, Europol recently reported 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children have now gone missing. Not one, ten, or a hundred children: 10,000 refugee children are missing. According to the authorities, they might have been taken by human traffickers, sex traders, or organ traffickers; as of this writing, no one is completely sure where they've disappeared to.\n\nEurope is one of the richest continents in the world, with a sizable area more than enough to accommodate one million refugees. After all, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, with significantly less wealth when compared to Europe and with much less area, generously opened their doors and welcomed close to a 4.8 million refugees in an approach praised as ‘the best example in the entire world’. Turkey alone has spent some $10 billion for 2.7 million refugees without any foreign help, even though it has a GDP of only $10,500 per capita.\n\nBut Europe has a completely different story: Take the “Calais Jungle” in the heart of Europe, on the coast of France, for instance. There is a reason why this place is called a ‘jungle’. The situation in this so-called camp is so horrible, it doesn't seem fit for anyone, especially for the children. Recently, it was reported that teenage boys are being raped in the camp, but still no real measures are taken.   Night after night many children dangerously seek ways to go to the UK, sometimes by stowing or hiding away in trucks: Many die in the process. French police treat them brutally, teargas them or beat them up when they are caught. On top of this, British government last week rejected permission to allow 3,500 unaccompanied refugee children from camps in Europe to enter Britain.\n\nSurely, there are exceptions in Europe, such as Sweden and Germany. Even though their efforts and help could be immensely larger given their economies and areas, their approach is laudable considering the attitude of the rest of Europe. In the same way, many European politicians, opinion leaders and Europeans adopt the same approach and promote enormous compassion for refugees. We hope that they will set a great example to the rest of their people and prove to the world once again that Europe is indeed a champion of human rights and a place of the highest standard of civilization and equality.\n\nMr. Adnan Oktar's (HARUN YAHYA) piece in American Herald Tribune:","id":"10154745760219060_10154745931269060"},{"like_count":0,"message":"Democrat elite seem to know a lot about this first hand, it's all on Huma's laptop.","id":"10154745760219060_10154745811914060"}]},"shares":21,"attachment":{"type":"share","title":"Tackling child-abuse requires understanding those who commit it","url":"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fecon.st%2F2evHC0m&h=pAQH716-L&s=1&enc=AZPCRcGnTvc_cTngJSH1GbnFjCh93dJGyRn8TgjD6pT7JU6n6T0Agakos3HXbHB5hfDwFTF6fu6GqUu4t6WZWgX3","img_url":"https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAau-L_XrPkVBMG&w=720&h=720&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.static-economist.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcf_images%2Fimages-magazine%2F2016%2F08%2F13%2FIR%2F20160813_IRD001_facebook.jpg&cfs=1"},"_id":"AXytylgWTsX2JS4o"}

Therefore, the Presidential election that is only weeks away closely concerns other countries as much as it concerns America. Among these countries, the foremost are the Middle Eastern countries, which have witnessed extensive military and political interventions by the US.\n\nAs it is well known, the military operations carried out, initiated or supported by the USA in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen under the slogans \"The fight against terrorism,\" \"Establishing peace, security and democracy\" have led to unprecedented destruction and catastrophes in Islamic countries.\n\nStill pursued relentlessly today, these military practices and policies of violence have neither provided a remedy for terrorism nor brought any benefit to the region and its people. On the contrary, violence has spurred greater violence; nourished by bloodshed and vengeance, the radical elements have now become more fanatical and ferocious than ever. Regional terrorism has reached global proportions and turned into an intractable, full-scale threat.\n\nThe erroneous policies of various US governments have brought about economic crises along with social strains. Taking their leaders as role models, some citizens have begun to turn to violence as the primary solution in every aspect of life.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that the number of deaths due to gun violence in the US between 2004 and 2013 stood at 316,000 whereas for the same period, the number of deaths due to terrorism was a mere 36 as pointed out by the government.\n\nSuicides and drug addiction are rampant among the veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Believed to be in hundreds, the annual suicide cases in the military remain unabated.\n\nCuriously, regardless of the political perspective of the President and the government, be it right, left, Democrat, Republican or nationalist, the US foreign policies remain unchanged in every term. For example, following the Bush administration, President Obama rose to the White House on a promise to end the military presence of the USA in Iraq and Afghanistan. However today, the US military operations in Iraq and Syria continue at full steam, while President Obama announces that he will keep 8,400 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nThis situation, which seems contradictory at first sight, is clearly explained in the article \"This is not a democracy: Behind the Deep State that Obama, Hillary or Trump couldn’t control\" featured in the US-based news and analysis site Salon as follows:\n\n\"Foreign policy never really changes regardless of who holds the WhiteHouse.\"\n\nWhen considered from this standpoint, the policy institutes and the key figures within these organizations that guide the foreign policies of the US from behind the scenes play an active role at every turn. These organizations consist of big think tanks such as Chatham House, the CFR, the Brookings Institution, the Rand Corporation, the Carnegie Endowment and CSIS.\n\nThe mastermind and main operator above all these organizations is one of the most influential think tanks of the world, the UK-based Chatham House, founded in 1919, and its US representative, the CFR (Council of Foreign Relations). It is these Anglo-Saxon oriented deep state mechanisms which introduce from day one and fund the US Presidents that are \"predetermined to be elected,\" who manage their campaigns and perception operations, who provide them consultancy, and systematically eliminate their opponents.\n\nHaving handed out its traditional annual prize to Hillary Clinton in 2013, Chatham House seems to have already determined its Presidential Candidate at the time. The same organizations present their pre-established agenda through their publications and direct suggestions as policies to be pursued by the very presidents they have had elected.\n\nIn fact, the research report \"The Future of US Global Leadership Implications for Europe, Canada and Transatlantic Cooperation,\" which was published in May 2016 in cooperation with Chatham House, serves as a pre-established agenda and instruction letter for the future President. The following lines from the report are quite striking:\n\n\"The 2016 presidential election is likely to have only a limited influence on the long-term factors underlying US foreign policy. Whether a Republican or a Democrat wins the presidency, the next occupant of the White House is likely to be more openly interventionist than Obama.\"\n\nIn short, if the new US President cannot escape the grip of Chatham House, the fate that awaits the Middle East and the Islamic world is quite disconcerting.\n\nIf the soon-to-be elected US President wants to achieve a historic success, they should display a fierce resolve and determination and cast aside these deep state-oriented politics and ideologies. They should not pursue survival-of-the-fittest policies at the behest of the Anglo-Saxon deep state and its affiliated extensions, such as the defense industry, the business world, the financial sector and the world's central banks.\n\nThe new US President should be able to establish a new foreign policy in the Middle East, free from the influence of the United Kingdom. Instead of the biased reports of Chatham House, the CFR or the Rand Corporation, they should adopt rationalistic, prudent and humane measures that will bring peace, comfort and security to the people of the region. They should urgently cancel the unmasked and widely hated projects such as the Greater Middle East Initiative that intend to shape the region through bloodshed and violence.\n\nInstead of learning the religion of Islam from Graham Fuller, Bernard Lewis, the Quilliam Foundation or the British-based think tanks, they should learn it from the true source of Islam, that is the Qur'an. They should realize that the only solution to eliminate the threat of radicalism and terrorism is through guiding people towards the true Islam preached by the Qur'an and base their policies regarding the Islamic world on the ideals of education, justice, peace and love.\n\nIn sum, the new President should start with a clean slate that is free from the hidden agendas imposed by the deep state mechanisms and their mentors, and based on the principles of wisdom, conscience and reason. They should look after the benefits and interests of the entire world and the whole of humanity instead of certain power groups. They should serve as an exemplary and leading model for all the countries suffering under the ruthless oppression of said power groups.\n\nMr. Adnan Oktar's (HARUN YAHYA)  piece in American Herald Tribune:","id":"10154745651849060_10154745934709060"},{"like_count":2,"message":"Business has gone along with the Yahoo Radical Right, when they ought to have been fighting for a pre-Gingrich Republican Party.

The offender is a Hindu, namely Roshraj Das. Locals reported that Roshraj Das put a Facebook status on 28 October, 2016 where he uploaded an image of a Pagan Idol sitting on the sacred Kaba Sharif. Seeing this, local Muslims bursted out in grievance and protested heavily. Due to that, local Police arrested the culprit. However, a conspiracy against the Muslim protesters began after the arrest. There was a charge pressed against about two thousand and four hundred Muslims stating that the Muslim protesters oppressed the Hindus during the protest and thus arrested many Muslims. It is to be mentioned that the Awami League is the current ruling party. Sheikh Hasina is the Chairperson of Awami League Govt. The Awami League Govt. is a close ally to the neighboring Pagan Hindu Country India. Due to that, the Bangladeshi Hindus have been frequently defaming Islam provided that they enjoy enormous support from Pagan India. It has been happening so often that it has almost become natural to defame Islam in Bangladesh. However, Awami Govt. has not taken any corrective measure regarding this; rather they have been oppressing the Muslim. In this circumstance, the Muslim of Bangladesh seeks support from the Muslims and the Islamic organizations of rest of the world so that they come forward to helping Islam and Muslims.","id":"10154064092622217_10154064117877217"},{"like_count":1,"message":"This country is responsible for state-sponsored killing of thousands of kangaroos.

Offices; Prep for Raids, Possible Arrests in Clinton Probes\nPosted on November 4, 2016 by admin\n\nFBI Director James Comey issued a mandate late Thursday instructing all available special agents from the Washington D.C. field office and Hoover Building headquarters to report to work immediately, federal law enforcement sources told True Pundit.\n\n“We’re preparing for many arrests from the top down,” the FBI source said. “I cannot elaborate beyond that.”\n\nWhen pressed to better define what “from the top down” meant in terms of possible suspects, the source refused to elaborate.\n\n“You’re a smart guy; read between the lines,” the source said.\n\nBased on case protocol, the FBI is either preparing to conduct sweeping search warrants in the Clinton Foundation investigation or ready to start arresting suspects. Or both. If a grand jury has been convened by the Justice Department since Comey’s decision to re-open the Hillary Clinton case last week, then the FBI could make arrests if indictments were handed down by Thursday (yesterday). If not, it is more likely FBI agents are being amassed for multiple simultaneous raids on suspects’ homes and businesses to secure warrant-backed evidence.\n\nWill search warrants be served on Friday? Based on FBI protocol, Friday raids are unorthodox in cases not involving kidnappings or investigations where human lives are at risk. Preparation for wide-scale raids can take 48 hours or more, depending on how many targets are in play.\n\nThe Clinton investigation has reached a fever pitch this week fueled by alarming new allegations first unveiled on Wednesday by True Pundit. New revelations from newly-recovered Clinton emails, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources linked to the probe said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:\n\nMoney laundering\nChild exploitation\nSex crimes with minors (children)\nPerjury\nPay to play through Clinton Foundation\nObstruction of justice\nOther felony crimes\n\nDocuments and emails released late Thursday by Wikileaks substantiated certain allegations of child exploitation linked to the Clinton Foundation; with Hillary as secretary of state and President Bill Clinton acting as a United Nation’s special envoy to Haiti after its devastating 2010 earthquake.","id":"1279397075413979_1279436578743362"},{"like_count":0,"message":"Trump followers - pay close attention\n\nSince Trump contacted me in early September 2016 via twitter to ask me, why I thought he is a deplorable nutbag - he has introduced me to some of the people in his inner circle.\nToday I got a phone call from his closest communication advisor saying, that Trump really valued the advice of Mr. Ahlm.

They add it up & take it out once a month. So, if you sold something for £1,000. eBay charges you £66.60 to pay later!

Offices; Prep for Raids, Possible Arrests in Clinton Probes\nPosted on November 4, 2016 by admin\n\nFBI Director James Comey issued a mandate late Thursday instructing all available special agents from the Washington D.C. field office and Hoover Building headquarters to report to work immediately, federal law enforcement sources told True Pundit.\n\n“We’re preparing for many arrests from the top down,” the FBI source said. “I cannot elaborate beyond that.”\n\nWhen pressed to better define what “from the top down” meant in terms of possible suspects, the source refused to elaborate.\n\n“You’re a smart guy; read between the lines,” the source said.\n\nBased on case protocol, the FBI is either preparing to conduct sweeping search warrants in the Clinton Foundation investigation or ready to start arresting suspects. Or both. If a grand jury has been convened by the Justice Department since Comey’s decision to re-open the Hillary Clinton case last week, then the FBI could make arrests if indictments were handed down by Thursday (yesterday). If not, it is more likely FBI agents are being amassed for multiple simultaneous raids on suspects’ homes and businesses to secure warrant-backed evidence.\n\nWill search warrants be served on Friday? Based on FBI protocol, Friday raids are unorthodox in cases not involving kidnappings or investigations where human lives are at risk. Preparation for wide-scale raids can take 48 hours or more, depending on how many targets are in play.\n\nThe Clinton investigation has reached a fever pitch this week fueled by alarming new allegations first unveiled on Wednesday by True Pundit. New revelations from newly-recovered Clinton emails, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said.

Enough is enough. Turkey could not allow fait accompli or a defacto  situation accross her borders. There was no option for Turkey other than to take a decisive action against both ISIS and YPG in Syria. \n\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon and their methods are same. Suicide bombings, IEDs, complex attacks and assassinations, and this is what both ISIS and YPG have been doing in Turkey. Now time has come to get rid of terror threat directed both by ISIS and PKK/YPG against Turkey from Syria. \n\nTurkey is using her legitimate self-defense right. No more game, the marriage between ISIS and YPG is over. YPG has been intentionally polished and advertised by its sponsors for another dirty agenda. Nobody really cared about destroying ISIS or bringing peace to war-torn Syria. Those YPG sponsors never cared really about the humanitarian tragedy in Syria and never wanted to bring Syrian civil war to a peaceful solution. YPG is dissmissed from now on and their fooling of whole world until now is finished by Turkish intervention. Even US Senate Investigation Committe uncovered that YPG is organically connected with PKK which is officially accepted as a terrorist organization by US. ISIS and YPG coexistence, and symbiotic closeness between both these two terrorist groups are terminated forever. \n\nTurkey is in charge now against both ISIS and YPG terrorist groups not only for her own citizens but also for all those refugees and Syrian people. Multinational coalition forces are providing air support to Turkey's anti-ISIS operation named Euphrates Shield. Turkish Joint Special Task Force is providing support to Free Syrian Army to fight against ISIS. Turkey has always defended the unity of Syria, but it was a very complex political game what took place in Syria. \n\nTurkey was always a scapegoat and target of internationally organized anti-Turkey hate rhetorics and dirty propaganda. Those who had hidden or conflicting agenda in Syria never wanted to destroy ISIS, otherwise ISIS could not even stand a week against any multi-national coalition ground forces. Nobody wanted to lose their main puppet ISIS in Syria. Until now Turkey welcomed 3 million refugees in a short notice and never been frankly supported by UN, EU and USA. Nobody really cared about Syrians but Turkey. Would Europe allow so many refugees to EU countries like Turkey?  Would they be able to control their borders against flood of 3 million refugees?\n\nSo stop lying and fabricating fish-tales about Turkey and try to show sincere solidarity in her struggle and fight against international terrorist groups. Turkey will not step aside and watch ISIS and YPG terrorists harm Turkey and the unity of her citizens. Those who perpetrated and are still perpetrating terror attacks against Turkey shall now face the consequences.\n\nLast but not last, terror whether it is conducted by ISIS, PKK ot YPG will never be able to subjugate Turkish people.","id":"1278082925545394_1278151305538556"},{"like_count":3,"message":"Correction: it is the pro-terror party members that have been arrested; like no eu country would allow a party operating in the political system on behalf of isis, Turkey will not allow the extention of a terror organization to abuse the political system.","id":"1278082925545394_1278217692198584"},{"like_count":4,"message":"Demirtaş is Hdp's leader and honour man.Hdp has 6 billion voter  in turkey this day. this arrest as a blow.

Bush presidency, and it has been growing increasingly virulent in more recent years. I am talking about the intimidation and bullying used by Republicans to coerce a desired outcome.  I first noticed it during the GOP-dominated Congress in the early 2000’s when the Democrats reminded me of an abused spouse, always compromising and giving in with the hope that the Republicans would work with them and play nice. Instead, the Democrats were viciously criticized and universally disdained, getting almost no conciliation on anything for their efforts.\r\n\nThe process seemed to move from the abused spouse archetype to the schoolyard bully archetype during the Obama administration. The message in essence was: If you don’t give us your lunch, we will beat you up.  In their attempts to defund Planned Parenthood or end Obamacare or force other ultra-conservative policy agendas, the GOP consistently refused to vote on mandatory budgets, on immigration reform, on Zika funding, and on judges or other appointments. They have even managed to shut down the entire government in an attempt to force an issue. Under Obama and the recent Democratic Congressional leaders, the intimidation has not often worked, but instead has led to government paralysis. Unfortunately, this still helped the GOP.  Government is now seen by many as ineffective and dysfunctional with little understanding of who was gumming up the works. Thus, the current “change” meme as a Republican campaign motto has had some impact.\r\n\nThe 2016 GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has been intimidating and bullying people for many years, long before he entered politics. Women did not press charges against him for his sexual predations due to a legitimate fear of financial or career ruin. With his aggressive legal, business, and public relations tactics, he viciously harmed the lives of countless individuals over decades. He even strong-armed editors to fire journalists who criticized him. In the current election cycle, there are few among Republicans who are willing to stand against him. Most are so fearful of his criticism and personal attacks that they swallow his long list of offensive and immoral words and deeds without a whimper. I will beat you up, if you don’t give me your lunch.\r\n\nIt may be that Hillary Clinton is the first person, and certainly the first woman, who has not been intimidated by the belligerent billionaire. Watching her stand unflinching and strong during the debates despite his hyper-inflated attacks and vicious rants was truly edifying. While Republicans cower in the shadows, Hillary didn’t even blink.  The courage and clarity to stand up to such bullying, which none of the GOP primary candidates and few of the GOP leadership has managed, is an extraordinary example of leadership by Hillary Clinton. In my opinion, it provides a worthy role model not just for women but for everyone.\r\n\nThe recent campaign drama in which FBI Director Comey has broken with all precedent and written a vague letter to Congress about more Clinton emails to examine, may be understood as yet another person compromising his integrity and judgement in response to GOP intimidation tactics. Comey has received withering criticism and attacks from the Right for refusing to indict Hillary over some sloppiness in the handling of emails. Anxious about subjecting himself to more of the same, Comey wrote his now infamous letter and dropped a bomb in the middle of the campaign. I think if we are to understand his actions, they should be seen within the context of the larger impact of GOP abusiveness and bullying and the warping of this trend on the integrity of our entire political system.  This is a frightening day in Democracy!\r\n\nComey lied and the FBI has been “officially infected” by the GOP Bully Boys and Trumpism.\r\n\nIF YOU CARE, SHARE!","id":"1277264535627233_1277381452282208"},{"like_count":0,"message":"PUTIN’S PUPPET ~ TRUMP, MANFORT AND HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF and SURROGATES:\r\n\nA former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence provided the FBI with information he says shows the Russian government has spent years trying to influence Donald Trump. \r\n\nIn June, the officer, who now works for a U.S. firm gathering information on Russia for corporate clients, was told to research the Republican presidential nominee's dealings in Russia, Mother Jones reported Monday night.\r\n\n\"It started off as a fairly general inquiry,\" the ex-spy said.\r\nAs he searched, he says he found “an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.\"\r\n\nCiting it as an “extraordinary situation,” the ex-intelligence officer sent a copy of his report to the FBI. \r\n\nIn it, he charged that Russian intelligence had \"compromised\" Trump and could \"blackmail him” and that it had a file on Hillary Clinton compiled from \"bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.\"\r\n\nHe said FBI officials greeted his July memo with “shock and horror” but did not request additional information.\r\n\nThe FBI then asked him for more memos in August, he added, prompting him to submit dossiers on members of Trump’s inner circle with ties to Russia.\r\n\n“It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he said of the FBI’s examination of Trump’s links to Moscow.\r\n“This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former spy added. “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”\r\n\nMother Jones said the ex-spy spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and now works with a U.S. firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients.\r\n\nThe former intelligence official began researching Trump earlier this year, it said, as part of an opposition research project funded by a Republican client critical of the billionaire.\r\n\nMother Jones added that the project’s funding switched to Democratic supporters before the anonymous source discovered troubling connections between Russia and Trump.\r\n\n“There was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit,” he said, according to Russian sources he contacted while researching Trump.\r\n\nTrump has repeatedly weathered criticism from Democrats and other Republicans over his sometimes warm tone toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.\r\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) alleged over that the FBI has “explosive information” about ties between Trump and the Russian government.\r\n\nReid declined to divulge additional details about the information or to clarify how federal officials discovered it during his Oct. 30 letter to FBI Director James Comey.\r\n\nFORMER CIA AGENT:  “Trump is Russia’s “Useful Fool”.\r\n\nPOLITIFACT:  “Yes, Trump does have MOB Ties in the USA and Russia”.\r\n\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PROVIDE THEIR TAXES TO SHOW TRANSPARENCY.

Bush presidency, and it has been growing increasingly virulent in more recent years. I am talking about the intimidation and bullying used by Republicans to coerce a desired outcome.  I first noticed it during the GOP-dominated Congress in the early 2000’s when the Democrats reminded me of an abused spouse, always compromising and giving in with the hope that the Republicans would work with them and play nice. Instead, the Democrats were viciously criticized and universally disdained, getting almost no conciliation on anything for their efforts.\r\n\nThe process seemed to move from the abused spouse archetype to the schoolyard bully archetype during the Obama administration. The message in essence was: If you don’t give us your lunch, we will beat you up.  In their attempts to defund Planned Parenthood or end Obamacare or force other ultra-conservative policy agendas, the GOP consistently refused to vote on mandatory budgets, on immigration reform, on Zika funding, and on judges or other appointments. They have even managed to shut down the entire government in an attempt to force an issue. Under Obama and the recent Democratic Congressional leaders, the intimidation has not often worked, but instead has led to government paralysis. Unfortunately, this still helped the GOP.  Government is now seen by many as ineffective and dysfunctional with little understanding of who was gumming up the works. Thus, the current “change” meme as a Republican campaign motto has had some impact.\r\n\nThe 2016 GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has been intimidating and bullying people for many years, long before he entered politics. Women did not press charges against him for his sexual predations due to a legitimate fear of financial or career ruin. With his aggressive legal, business, and public relations tactics, he viciously harmed the lives of countless individuals over decades. He even strong-armed editors to fire journalists who criticized him. In the current election cycle, there are few among Republicans who are willing to stand against him. Most are so fearful of his criticism and personal attacks that they swallow his long list of offensive and immoral words and deeds without a whimper. I will beat you up, if you don’t give me your lunch.\r\n\nIt may be that Hillary Clinton is the first person, and certainly the first woman, who has not been intimidated by the belligerent billionaire. Watching her stand unflinching and strong during the debates despite his hyper-inflated attacks and vicious rants was truly edifying. While Republicans cower in the shadows, Hillary didn’t even blink.  The courage and clarity to stand up to such bullying, which none of the GOP primary candidates and few of the GOP leadership has managed, is an extraordinary example of leadership by Hillary Clinton. In my opinion, it provides a worthy role model not just for women but for everyone.\r\n\nThe recent campaign drama in which FBI Director Comey has broken with all precedent and written a vague letter to Congress about more Clinton emails to examine, may be understood as yet another person compromising his integrity and judgement in response to GOP intimidation tactics. Comey has received withering criticism and attacks from the Right for refusing to indict Hillary over some sloppiness in the handling of emails. Anxious about subjecting himself to more of the same, Comey wrote his now infamous letter and dropped a bomb in the middle of the campaign. I think if we are to understand his actions, they should be seen within the context of the larger impact of GOP abusiveness and bullying and the warping of this trend on the integrity of our entire political system.  This is a frightening day in Democracy!\r\n\nComey lied and the FBI has been “officially infected” by the GOP Bully Boys and Trumpism.\r\n\nIF YOU CARE, SHARE!","id":"1277283942291959_1277379968949023"},{"like_count":0,"message":"In a bombshell report, Fox News' Brett Baier reports that two FBI sources with \"intimate knowledge\" of the Clinton Foundation investigation are saying that the probe will likely end in indictment.\n\nOn Wednesday's \"On The Record\" Baier laid out several details he's learned from those sources:\n\n1) \"The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported, I think, so far.\"\n\n2) Despite reports that laptops belonging to Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, two top aides for Hillary Clinton, were supposedly set to be destroyed according to their immunity agreement with the Justice Department, the devices are still intact.\n\n\"We have been told that those definitively have not been destroyed,\" Baier said. \"They are at the FBI field office here in Washington and are being exploited.\"\n\n3) The evidence in the Clinton Foundation probe is being described as \"a lot of it\" and that there is \"an avalanche coming every day with WikiLeaks and the new emails.\" Some people involved in the investigation are now being interviewed for the third time.\n\n4) Anthony Weiner's laptop contained new emails and not simply \"duplicates\" as some Clinton defenders have suggested.\n\n\"The classified investigation is being run by the national security division of the FBI,\" Baier reports. \"They are currently, as Catherine Herridge has reported, combing through Anthony Weiner's laptop, and they are having some success in what they believe to be new emails, not duplicates, that have been...emailed through the server.\"\n\n5) The sources believe with \"99% certainty\" that Clinton's server had been hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies.\n\n6) Baier also said that when he pressed his two sources about likely outcomes of the investigations, they told him that, barring obstruction, they are likely to lead to an indictment.","id":"1277283942291959_1277290565624630"},{"like_count":0,"message":"Reflection time - Trump - you exist only on borrowed time!\n\nDear ignorant deplorable Trump followers\n\nYou have two choices for choosing the next president.

Lord (William) Hague, chair of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). RUSI, who are supposedly impartial US and UK government defence advisors, are sponsored by Babcock, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Rolls-Royce.\n\nBut one of the most telling individuals is Labour’s Lord Hutton, defence secretary under Gordon Brown. He is an adviser to Bechtel, consultant for Lockheed Martin and chair of the Nuclear Industries Association (NIA). The revolving door (the phrase used to describe MP’s who, once finished in parliament, go into jobs related to their previous role) has never spun so quickly.\n\nIt may be no wonder then, that the majority of parliament (excluding the SNP and the Green party) are supportive of renewing Trident.\n\nWith reference to the role of multinational financial institutions, all the companies listed above, aside from being involved in Trident, share one other common denominator. They are all financed, or owned, by UK banks. Specifically Barclays and HSBC. A report by Don’t Bank on the Bomb details the involvement of major financial institutions in the western nuclear weapons industry.\nWhat this report doesn’t cover, however, is these institutions involvement in Russia’s nuclear weapons industry.\n\nLaughing all the way to the bank\n\nAside from financing state-owned Russian companies like Rostec State Corporation (heavily involved with the country’s military) via their funding of, and credit trading with, Rostec financiers Novikombank, these banks have directly financed the Trident equivalent in Russia.\n\nThe Dolgorukiy class submarine programme is Putin’s very own Trident. Made by a company called Sevmash, it’s financed by the state-owned Vnesheconombank (VEB) development bank. In turn, VEB bank is financed by a consortium of international banks. These include, of course, Barclays and HSBC.\n\nEssentially, UK multinational banks are playing one big game of “Battleships”, funding both UK and Russian nuclear weapons programmes. Except no missiles will ever be fired, and a winner will never be declared – because that would be unprofitable.\n\nBut the most shocking aspect of this is one financial institution so far not mentioned: the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).\n\nRBS are also financiers of the VEB bank who fund Russia’s nuclear submarines – and they also invest or part-own seven companies directly contracted to Trident. What is most deplorable about this is the fact that RBS is, of course, state-owned –  we bought a 79% majority stake after the 2008 financial crash.\n\nIn layman’s terms? We, the public, pay for Trident directly via taxation. We also paid for RBS, directly through taxation. In turn, RBS directly fund (with UK taxpayer money) our “enemy’s” nuclear weapon systems.\n\nEssentially, the UK taxpayer is paying for both sides in this perceived nuclear stand-off.\n\nThe whole nuclear weapons industry – every disturbed, finger-pointed warning about Russia, every argument about our “national security” – is one mammoth ruse.\n\nWe, the taxpayer, are duped into allowing complicit Governments to squander our money on an imaginary threat, which merely serves to make former MPs richer and multinational banks and their wealthy shareholders more money.\n\nThe most dangerous enemy facing us in 2016? The lies we are told, under the premise of a threat which doesn’t actually exist.","id":"1276965428990477_1276983232322030"},{"like_count":0,"message":".FB is trashed by Putin's trolls turning Americans against each other.

and advancing world over for everyone of us to stay and enjoy,it would favour neither the Americans,Russians nor the world if we continue to see America and Russia entangled in harsh and strong bickering that can possibly lead the world to another World War...\nThe world shouldnt forget what recent time international bickering between the Americans and the Russians had cost the world in the last few years to now,infacts,it's cost the world a lot of destructions humanly,infrastructurally and economicallly,very colossal indeed...\nThe recent international bickering between Americans and Russians had cost the world the largest figure of displaced persons across the world after the 2nd World War due to the Americans and Russians Power tussling in Syria...\nThe destructions ongoing in Syria that have indeed seriously and devastatingly affected the world peace and decorum today wouldn't have happened if the rivalry and agelong feud between the two world power blocs were properly and diplomatically addressed and tamed by concerned leaders of the two warring giants of the world...\nThe same Americans and Russians feud led to the retake over of Crimea by Russians from Ukraine which eventually led to the sudden and unprecedented downward drift of the international Oil pricing due to spurious economic sanctions on the Russians by the Obama's administration and it's western allies... \nThe economic sanctions on Russians by the Obama's administration and their western allies for retaking over Crimea from Ukraine constrained and compelled the Obama's administration to cut the Americans usual huge purchase of Oil and gas from outside America which eventually led to huge local exploration of Americans oil by the Obama's admnistration,an unprecedented development that hasn't happened before but has to be forcefully executed to be able to justify the economic sanctions of Obama's administration on the Russians...\nAmericans stopping to buy crude oil from out side America and resulting to exploration of their own crude oil for sometime now,has forcefully brought down the international oil pricing which has drastically affected the general economic wellbeing of all Oil driven countries and economies of which our own Nigeria belongs and partly suffers from presently...\nThe whole Europe is hugely infiltrated and proliferated with ISIL dangerous and terror cells of mass destructions today because of the untamed bickering and feud between the Americans and the Russians.The whole world that's experiencing economic and security instability today is also as a result of the undue,untamed and unnecessary bickering between Americans and the Russians today...\nSo till when will all of this power tussling between these two power mongers continue to cost the world the necessary peace and tranquility it needs to stabilise and set a pace for requisite advancement of all the inhabitants of the world considering the enormosity of the World economic pontentials?...\nIf Amerrica and Russia do not settle,how would Syria settles,how would South Sudan/Dafour internal crisis that urgently needed the attention of the World powers settles,how would the international awareness and attention needed by the Biafrans for the quick actualization of their Biafra Republic granted if the Americans and Russians that formed the nucleous of the G8 do not come together again?   \nIf Donald Trump now comes around to say he wanna mend fences with the Russians,then to all peace loving Americans,Russians and peoples of the world,it's a most welcoming idea,at least for peace,prosperity,love and prosterity to reign,afterall,Obama too,found solace and fairness in ending the long year feud between the Americans and the Cubans,it's all for the sake of peace and tranquility and where there is peace,love and peaceful co-existence among the multi different peoples of the world,the world becomes a safer place for progress and stability to stand...\nObama and his evil merchants tore apart the peace,love and progress of the world in their last eight years of massive quantum destructions of the world.May God Almighty reward Obama and his evil peers according to their evil dids to humanity IJN...\nTo me,I want the Americans to overlook some personal lapses of Donald Trump which I believe might have occurred due to his wealthy lifestyle and his social care free attitude.It's however partinent and patriotic for all vote-able Americans,if they have to choose a better candidate for the WhiteHouse considering the two most contending choices left for them to pick from,I solidly believe,Donald Trump stand better of the two...\nAmericans should go for Donald Trump,he's their best choice considering what they have at hand,just has the Nigerian peoples had Former President Goodluck Ebele Azikwe Jonathan as their better choice between he and our unrepentant illiterate dictator and tyrant in the Nigerian 2015 general elections but refused to see the light and went for their own jugular by voting for the return of suffering,militirization,anarchy,unconstitutionality,nepotism and most destructively,the present avoidable economic recession Nigerians brought unto themselves... \n#IGOFORTRUMP...","id":"10154066085527217_10154066229047217"},{"like_count":14,"message":"'Idiots' banned from casting a ballot?......who does that leave

Why not give them the opportunity to rebuild their city first instead of flooding it it refugees? Globalism is a powerplay by the elites that will never have to deal with its horrible outcome.

If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him.
